# Screenlovers

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.0.1.

## Description

Screenlovers is a web app that allows you to discover thousands of movies and related people (actors, directors, writers,...), using the TMDB API. The app is wanted to be lighter than the tmdb.org site. It's like a portal to more data over there.
I just wanted to work on an Angular app, and propose a lighter and visually different way to discover the universe of movies.

### Techs used

Angular (Typescript, HTML, SCSS)
Autoprefixer
Git (Github)
Personnal assets

#### Credits

Thanks to TMDB.org to allow the free use of its great API.
